Step 1: Update your Raspberry Pi
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Step 2: Install Git and Docker
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sudo sh get-docker.sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   sudo apt install -y git

Step 3: Reboot your Pi
   sudo reboot

Step 4: Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/EdiynB/Tranga-App.git
   cd Tranga-App/App

Step 5: Get your Pi's IP address
   hostname -I

Step 6: Start the application
   # We are now using pre-built images from GitHub to save memory on your Pi Zero 2W.
   
   # A. Pull the latest code
   git pull origin main
   
   # B. Download the pre-built images
   # If this says "denied", see the Troubleshooting section below!
   RPi_IP=<YOUR_PI_IP> docker-compose pull
   
   # C. Start everything
   RPi_IP=<YOUR_PI_IP> docker-compose up -d

Step 7: Access the app
   Open a browser on your computer and go to: http://<YOUR_PI_IP>

Troubleshooting: "Permission Denied" on Pull
GitHub makes new packages "Private" by default. You need to make them "Public" so your Pi can download them without a login:
1. Go to your GitHub profile and click the "Packages" tab.
2. Click on "tranga-app-api" and "tranga-app-frontend".
3. Go to "Package Settings".
4. Scroll to the bottom and click "Change visibility".
5. Set to "Public" and confirm.
6. Try Step 6B again.

Troubleshooting: Crashes/Freezes
If your Pi Zero 2W still feels slow:
1. Ensure your Swap is set to 2048MB:
   - sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile -> Change CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048
   - sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile restart
2. Use a high-speed SD card (Class 10 / A1).
