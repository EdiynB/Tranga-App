Step 1: Update your Raspberry Pi
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Step 2: Install Git and Docker
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sudo sh get-docker.sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   sudo apt install -y git

Step 3: Reboot your Pi (Important for Docker permissions)
   sudo reboot

Step 4: Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/EdiynB/Tranga-App.git
   cd Tranga-App/App

Step 5: Get your Pi's IP address
   hostname -I

Step 6: Start the application (Sequential Build recommended for RPi)
   # Running both builds at once can crash the Pi. Do them one by one:
   
   # A. Build the Backend
   RPi_IP=192.168.1.100 docker-compose build tranga-api
   
   # B. Build the Frontend
   RPi_IP=192.168.1.100 docker-compose build tranga-frontend
   
   # C. Start everything
   RPi_IP=192.168.1.100 docker-compose up -d

Step 7: Access the app
   Open a browser on your computer and go to: http://192.168.1.100

Troubleshooting Crashes:
If your Pi freezes during build, it's likely out of memory (OOM). 
Try increasing your swap file:
1. sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
2. Change CONF_SWAPSIZE=100 to CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048
3. sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile restart
4. Try the build commands in Step 6 again.
