Step 1: Update your Raspberry Pi
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Step 2: Install Git and Docker
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sudo sh get-docker.sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   sudo apt install -y git

Step 3: Reboot your Pi
   sudo reboot

Step 4: Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/EdiynB/Tranga-App.git
   cd Tranga-App/App

Step 5: Get your Pi's IP address
   hostname -I

Step 6: Start the application
   # We are now using pre-built images from GitHub to save memory on your Pi Zero.
   
   # A. Pull the latest code and images
   git pull origin main
   RPi_IP=<YOUR_PI_IP> docker-compose pull
   
   # B. Start everything
   RPi_IP=<YOUR_PI_IP> docker-compose up -d

Step 7: Access the app
   Open a browser on your computer and go to: http://<YOUR_PI_IP>

Troubleshooting for Pi Zero 2W:
Since this device has limited RAM (512MB), we build the images on GitHub instead of on the Pi.
If it still feels slow:
1. Ensure your Swap is set to 2048MB (see previous instructions).
2. Use a high-speed SD card (Class 10 / A1).
3. Give it a few minutes to start up on the first run.
